### About me

Working as a Korean language teacher, I helped many people pursue their dreams. Now I feel like I have got one of my own. And that is to become a full-time front-end developer. Coding became my main passion and I cannot spend a day without challenging a task in codewars or reading a book on Javascript. I am eager to learn new concepts, create projects and develop my frontend skills. 

My greatest strength is an ability to multi-task on different projects. I am also well-organized and always pay attention to detail. At the same time, it is important for me to keep my work-life balance, so I always try to stay healthy and happy.
